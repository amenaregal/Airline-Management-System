# Airline-Management-System

This C++ program is a console-based flight reservation system that allows users to register, book flights, print tickets, view all booked tickets, and cancel reservations. It collects personal information such as ID, name, gender, age, and passport number, ensuring proper validation for each input to maintain data accuracy. Users can select from various flight destinations like Dubai, Canada, UK, USA, Australia, and Europe, each offering multiple flight options with different times and fares. Once a flight is booked, the system generates and displays a ticket with complete user and flight details. All bookings are stored using a vector of structures, allowing multiple reservations in a session. The program also provides an option to cancel a reservation by entering the user ID and offers the user a chance to rebook. It ensures a smooth user experience with validation checks and clear instructions throughout the process.
